## Deveron Catchment Watercourse Mapping and Electrofishing Analysis ##
Project Overview
This repository contains geospatial data and analysis related to watercourse mapping and electrofishing analysis conducted in the Deveron catchment area. The project involved the creation of a modified map displaying watercourse links, along with associated electrofishing data and habitat information. The map was created using ArcGIS 3.1, and the electrofishing data was sourced from the Scottish Fishery Coordination Centre (SFCC) database.

Data Sources
GIS Layers from SEPA: Geographic data layers were downloaded from the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA). These layers were used to generate a modified map that highlights watercourse links within the Deveron catchment area.

Electrofishing Data from SFCC Database: The electrofishing data includes several tables obtained from the SFCC database:

A table containing British National Grid references, Easting, and Northing for electrofishing sites.
Two separate tables (quantitative 1mm and timed) displaying the density of juvenile salmon and trout caught during electrofishing, along with the presence or absence of eel.
A summary of habitat information at each electrofishing survey site, including altitude, predominant depth range, average width, area affected by siltation, canopy cover, main land use type, number of of obstructions, instream cover and predominant substrate.
Analysis Process
Map Creation: The watercourse map was generated using ArcGIS 3.1. SEPA GIS layers were utilized to highlight the watercourse links specifically within the Deveron catchment area. The map includes a compass, symbols indicating the names of rivers and burns, scales, and other cartographic elements.

Electrofishing Data Integration: The electrofishing data from the SFCC database was integrated into the map. The British National Grid references, Easting, and Northing coordinates were used to geolocate the electrofishing sites on the map.

Electrofishing Analysis: The quantitative (1mm) and timed electrofishing data tables were utilized to analyze the density of juvenile salmon and trout caught during electrofishing operations. The presence (quantitative 1mm) or total caught number (timed) of eel was also noted. This analysis contributed insights into fish populations and distribution within the catchment.

Habitat Summary: The habitat summary data provided information about the environment at each electrofishing survey site. Details such as altitude, predominant depth range, average width, canopy cover, and predominant substrate were included.

Report Integration
The final map, along with the electrofishing data analysis and habitat summary, was integrated into a visualized report. The map visually represents the watercourse links and electrofishing sites, providing context for the electrofishing data analysis and habitat information. The report showcases the findings and insights derived from the combined analysis.
